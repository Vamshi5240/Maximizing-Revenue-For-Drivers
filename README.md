Project: Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Maximum Cab Drivers Revenue
This project analyzes taxi cab payment trends using SQL and Python. Key steps include:
Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover payment trends.
Statistical Analysis: Applied SciPy and StatsModels to assess payment type preferences, revealing a significant inclination towards credit card payments.
Hypothesis Testing: Performed hypothesis testing, yielding a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value < 0.05, indicating a significant difference in average fares based on payment method.
